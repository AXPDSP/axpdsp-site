** Writing a Newsletter Entry
The newsletter builder expects news entries to be organized in any directory
structure in the ~./newsletter~ directory. The newsletters MUST be Markdown files,
and SHOULD contain the headers title, author, position, and date. The date
should be formatted as a string in the ~"yyyy-mm-dd"~ format.

Here is an example newsletter entry:
#+begin_src markdown
---
title: The New AXPDSP Website is Complete
author: Reily Siegel
position: Newsletter Editor
date: 2023-06-01
---

Our Website has been completed!

## A Subsection
We are now inside a subsection.
#+end_src

The newsletter builder can be called with the command ~clj
-A:newsletter-builder~, but it shouldn't need to be done manually.
