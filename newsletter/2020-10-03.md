Brotherhood Retreat is always an important event, however this year it was
especially valuable. Due to COVID restrictions, this was the first and only time
during this academic year that the entire Brotherhood gathered together. During
this time, we participated in many bonding activities, including hiking and lawn
games at Purgatory Chasm, and concluded the day with a meaningful discussion on
the state of the Brotherhood via Zoom. Despite the accommodations that needed to
be made for COVID restrictions, this event was successful in bonding the
Brotherhood together in a time when maintaining such bonds remotely presents a
significant challenge.
