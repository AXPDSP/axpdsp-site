# A New Website
I have recently been working on a new website for our chapter, and am proud to
present this progress!

## Advantages
This new version of the website, although it appears very similar, has a number
of advantages:

- Written entirely in Clojure/Script
- Rendered entirely in-browser
- Able to dynamically generate content from markdown files
- CI/CD
- Easier to maintain
