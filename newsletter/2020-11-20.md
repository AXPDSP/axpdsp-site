This year, to comply with COVID restrictions and ensure that everyone interested
in rushing our Fraternity have an opportunity to do so, we held our first ever
Virtual Rush. Despite initial concerns that we would be unable to recreate the
experience of an in-person Rush virtually, Rush was more successful than we ever
could have imagined. We will be carrying lessons we learned from operating a
Virtual Rush forward, and using this valuable experience to improve our
in-person Rush experience in the future.
